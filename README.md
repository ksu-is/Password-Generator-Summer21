# Password-Generator-Summer21
This is the repository for the code for my final project. It is a password generator that generates a random set of alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric  characters and then stores it into a text file. It will save the generated password with the respective website and username that it was created for. Anyone can use this program to help keep their private information secure and organized. Since it would be local to their computer it would likely be impossible for the usersâ€™ passwords to become compromised.
